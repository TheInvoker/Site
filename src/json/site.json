        "On my free time I spend time with my friends by hanging out or going out to social events. Every time an opportunity arises where it could benefit me later in my career, I try to learn it so that I can be well prepared. Most of my friends see me as a very ambitious and hardworking person who always continues to learn new things in life while preparing other things trying to stay steps ahead."
