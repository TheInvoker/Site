        "I graduated from University of Toronto (UTSC) with a B.Sc degree in 2015 specializing in Computer Science (co-op). My interests include web development, programming, algorithms, artificial intelligence, game development, software design, UI/UX, image editing, computer engineering and entrepreneurship. Other than technical things, I like to play chess (have competed in tournaments before), sudoku, hiking, and recently, long distance running.",
        "I spend a lot of time working on personal projects and like to participate in extracurricular activities with teams such as coding competitions/hackathons. My dream, which I actively try to work towards, is to build a successful startup company and make an impact on the world.",
        "On my free time I spend time with my friends by hanging out or going out to social events. Every time an opportunity arises where it could benefit me later in my career, I try to learn it so that I can be well prepared. Most of my friends see me as a very ambitious and hardworking person who always continues to learn new things in life while preparing other things trying to stay steps ahead."
